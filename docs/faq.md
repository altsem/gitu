# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What is Gitu?

Gitu is a **Git client** - a terminal user interface for managing Git repositories. It helps you perform Git operations like staging, committing, branching, and pushing changes through an intuitive text-based interface.

## What is Gitu NOT?

- **Audio software**: Gitu is not related to audio recording, audio processing, sound effects, or any multimedia functionality
- **Media player**: Gitu cannot play or edit audio/video files  
- **General purpose editor**: While it can view and edit Git-related content, it's specifically designed for Git operations

## Is this similar to "mini-audio" or audio libraries?

No, Gitu has no relation to audio libraries, "mini-audio", or sound processing. The name similarity is purely coincidental.

## What does "Git porcelain" mean?

A "Git porcelain" is a high-level, user-friendly interface for Git (as opposed to Git's low-level "plumbing" commands). Gitu provides an intuitive way to interact with Git repositories.

## Who should use Gitu?

Gitu is for developers and anyone who works with Git repositories and wants:
- A more visual way to manage Git operations than command-line Git
- An alternative to GUI Git clients that works in the terminal
- A Magit-like experience outside of Emacs

## How is Gitu related to Magit?

Gitu is inspired by [Magit](https://magit.vc/), which is a popular Git interface for Emacs. Gitu aims to bring similar functionality to users who don't use Emacs.
