You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental        |
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this       |
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.             |
If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may        |
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:              |
  git switch -c <new-branch-name>                                               |
Or undo this operation with:                                                    |
  git switch -                                                                  |
Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false    |
HEAD is now at b66a0bf add initial-file                                         |
